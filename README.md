# image_recognition_system

Image Recognition System is a convolutional neural network (CNN) project for classifying images from the Caltech-101 dataset (101 classes). The model uses custom residual blocks and transfer learning to improve feature extraction and convergence.

Data preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance generalization. The network was trained for 5 epochs, monitoring loss and accuracy on both training and validation sets. Evaluation demonstrates effective classification across multiple classes, and insights from model performance guide potential improvements.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
